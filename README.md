# word_counter_repo 🎯

just a tiny repo where i threw together a word-count script because why not. Im just vibing with python and terminal stuff.

## what's inside

- `word_count.py` - main script, run it with `python word_count.py path/to/file.txt` or install with packaging and use `word-count` command.

## packaging

run this once to install locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

you'll get a `word-count` command you can run from anywhere.

and yeah, it's all just for practice. i'm not trying to win a hackathon.
